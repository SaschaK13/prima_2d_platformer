    <p>A long time ago a curse was placed over the country. Since then it has been in constant dawn and dark. The source of all evil is the vengeful wizard who has withdrawn to the largest castle in the country and plans further, dark machinations from there. To this day, no one has dared to get anywhere near the wizard and his creatures. But the common people have recently started talking about a bold, brave hero whose reputation precedes him. The player takes on the role of the unknown hero and has to work his way through the forest of horrors, over the castle walls, through the city of monsters to the castle of the evil wizard.</p>
